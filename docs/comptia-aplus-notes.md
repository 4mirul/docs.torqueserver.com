### Troubleshooting Theory

!!! warning

    If the customer is using their organization's laptop, there might be procedures and policies that they must follow when using the laptop. They should check it with their organization's IT.

**Step 1:** Identify the problem

- Question the User and identify User changes to computer and perform backups before making changes
- Inquire regarding environmental or Infrastructure changes
- Review system and application logs

**Step 2:** Establish a theory of probable cause(question the obvious)

- If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms

**Step 3:** Test the theory to determine cause

- Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve problem
- If theory is not confirmed re-establish new theory or escalate

**Step 4:** Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution

**Step 5:** Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures

**Step 6:** Document findings, actions and outcome

!!! info "ChatGPT Troubleshooting Theory"

    The troubleshooting theory typically consists of the following steps:

    1. Identify the problem: The first step is to identify the problem that needs to be solved. This can be done by gathering information from the user or system logs.

    2. Gather information: Once the problem is identified, gather as much information as possible about the problem. This may include error messages, system logs, user reports, or any other relevant information.

    3. Analyze the information: Analyze the information gathered to identify the root cause of the problem. This may involve identifying patterns or commonalities between different incidents.

    4. Develop a hypothesis: Based on the analysis, develop a hypothesis about what is causing the problem. This hypothesis should be testable and verifiable.

    5. Test the hypothesis: Test the hypothesis by taking action and observing the results. This may involve making changes to the system or software, or gathering additional information.

    6. Iterate: If the hypothesis is not correct, go back to step 4 and develop a new hypothesis based on the new information. Iterate until the problem is solved.

    7. Implement a solution: Once the root cause of the problem is identified, implement a solution to fix it. This may involve making changes to the system, software, or user behavior.

    8. Monitor and evaluate: Monitor the system or software to ensure that the problem has been fully resolved. Evaluate the effectiveness of the solution and make further changes if necessary.

    By following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and solve problems in various systems and software.
